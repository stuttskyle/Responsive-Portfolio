                    <p>
                        My name is Kyle Stutts, but I prefer to be addressed by my middle name, Hunter. My mom has never even called my by my first
                        name, unless I was up to no good, and then it was by my full name. I grew up living with my Mom and Grandma in South Austin 
                        until I was about 7 years old. My Mom and I moved to Pflugerville, which is basically just North Austin, until I was about 16.
                        Finally, we moved to Round Rock until I went to college at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Go Roadrunners!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I only attended UTSA for one year before I moved back to Round Rock to attend Austin Community College to take some courses. I now
                        live in Georgetown, and I'm currently attending the University of Texas at Austin for a certification. I have a variety of hobbies, include music and
                        sports! I am a dedicated, die hard fan of America's Team, the Dallas Cowboys, and the San Antonio Spurs. I'm also off and on learning
                        to play the guitar, because I was always told it's never too late to learn!
